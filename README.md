Academic project for Business and Society class

Businesses and society are interconnected, and one way they are linked is through the impact of societal factors on business risks. 

In this project, I aim to analyze a measurable risk influenced by Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors in the corporate world, known as the ESG risk rating. 

Morningstar Sustainalytics offers extensive coverage of analyst-based ESG Risk Ratings, making it a valuable data source. 

While the goal was to compare ESG risk ratings across all sectors, the data was limited to the consulting services sector. 

Consequently, the focus shifted to the financial services sector, which is the destination for the largest percentage of Goizueta Class of 2023 graduates (36.2%).
